      <h3>
        Goals
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>As much information as possible is public to allow verification
          by any interested third-party.</li>
        <li>Consists of multiple independent systems to make it impossible for
          a single well-placed individual to attack.</li>
        <li>Votes are private.</li>
        <li>Voters can verify their vote was recorded correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
      <h2>
        <a name="description" class="anchor" href="#description"></a>
        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
      My hypothetical system consists of three completely independent components:
      an authenticator, a key signer, and a vote recorder (all separate from the
      voter's client system). For optimal security, each should be developed by
      a separate group and kept completely isolated. All source should be
      published, and each riding or district should have their own instances
      with their own keys, to reduce the chance a single attacker could control
      the entire election.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Voter's Perspective
      </h3>

      <p>
      In order to vote, the voter generates a public/private key pair and a
      symmetric key. They encrypt their public key with the symmetric key, and
      submit the resulting ciphertext to the authenticator, along with legal
      proof of identity (e.g. a driver's license or passport). The authenticator
      signs and publishes the ciphertext.
      </p>

      <p>
      The voter then submits the signed ciphertext and their symmetric key to
      the key-signer, which verifies the authenticator's signature, decrypts the
      ciphertext to reveal a public key, then signs and publishes the voter's
      public key.
      </p>

      <p>
      Finally, the voter signs their vote with their private key, and publishes
      it to the vote recorder. Anyone can verify that the vote was signed by a
      private key whose corresponding public key was signed by the key-signer,
      and that that private key was only used once.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Authenticator
      </h3>

      <p>
      This component is responsible for authenticating that a person is who they
      say they are, and is eligible to vote. Initial data consists of the
      electoral voter list (which is public) along with a public/private key
      pair. Eligible voters may at any time submit proof of identity (whatever
      that means in your country) as well as an opaque blob. On successful
      authentication, the system permanently publishes the signed blob alongside
      the voter's identity.
      </p>

      <p>
      This system guarantees that it will only ever sign a single blob for each
      eligible voter. Since the voter list and signed blobs are public, the
      maximum number of possible legitimate votes is publicly verifiable.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Key Signer
      </h3>

      <p>
      This component is responsible for signing and publishing voters' public
      keys. Its only initial state is a public/private key pair (different from
      that used by the authenticator). At any time, an eligible voter may submit
      a blob signed by the authenticator alongside their symmetric key. The
      system verifies the authenticator's signature, decrypts the blob, then
      signs and permanently publishes the resulting plaintext public key.
      </p>

      <p>
      This system guarantees it will only sign public keys which are first
      verified by the authenticator. By immediately discarding the symmetric key
      after decrypting the blob, the window in which an identity may be linked
      to a signed key is kept to a minimum. Anyone can verify that the number of
      signed keys is less than or equal to the number of signatures published
      by the authenticator.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Vote Recorder
      </h3>

      <p>
      This component is responsible for receiving and publishing votes. At any
      time a voter may sign their vote with their private key and submit the
      signed vote to the recorder. The recorder verifies that the corresponding
      public key was signed by the key-signer, and records the vote alongside
      the signed public key.
      </p>

      <p>
      This system guarantees that each private key can only be used to sign a
      single vote, and that users can see their vote recorded publically to
      verify at any time.
      </p>

      <!-- ATTACKS -->
      <h2>
        <a name="attacks" class="anchor" href="#attacks"></a>
        Possible Attacks
      </h2>

      <h3>
        Common Problems
      </h3>

      <p>
      Like any remote voting system, without physically private ballots it is
      possible for individuals to be coerced in their voting. Without physical
      presence it is also more difficult to accurately authenticate voters,
      since forging a piece of identity (e.g. a driver's license) is a lot
      simpler when the photo does not have to match your face. The security of
      the system also depends heavily on the underlying crypto; if an attacker
      can cheaply crack symmetric or asymmetric keys then all bets are off.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Casting Additional Votes
      </h3>

      <p>
      An attacker with access to the private key of either the authenticator or
      the key-signer could cast additional unauthorized votes. However, the
      number of votes they could cast without detection would be limited in
      several ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If the key-signer publishes more signatures than the authenticator,
          this is easily detectable by any third-party, and invalidates the
          election. Therefore every additional vote cast would require an
          identity on the electoral role.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any voter who submits to the authenticator but not the key-signer
          would leave their identity open for the above attack, but I expect that
          number to be extremely low since most voters would use software to
          accomplish both steps in quick succession.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eligible voters who do not even submit to the authenticator could have
          their identities co-opted for this purpose, but if any significant
          number of identities were stolen, such people would be able to complain.
          Ameliorating tactics might be to permit "null" or "protest" votes to
          be registered through the normal process (thus consuming an identity),
          and to send a "thank you for voting" notification to each consumed
          identity, alerting non-voters that their identity had been co-opted.
        </li>
        <li>
          With full access to the authenticator, an attacker could simply create
          additional identities on the electoral role, but this would be
          difficult to do at any sort of scale without detection since the list
          is publicly auditable.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        Changing or Revoking Votes
      </h3>

      <p>
      This attack is effectively impossible without detection. Since every
      signature by the authenticator is published, every signature by the
      key-signer is published, and every vote received by the recorder is
      published, there is no room for a changed or revoked vote to exist without
      trivial detection by the voter or a third party.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Miscounting Votes
      </h3>

      <p>
      This attack is effectively impossible; every signed vote is individually
      published, so any person would be able to trivially check the counts.
      I expect each major new organization would run their own counter simply in
      order to publish the most up-to-the-minute results.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Identifying Voters
      </h3>

      <p>
      An attacker with full access to the key-signer would be able to identify
      voters at will, since they would be able to record the mapping from signed
      ciphertext to public key which protects that information.
      </p>

      <p>
      There is also the possibility of a timing attack here, by correlating
      published blobs from the authenticator with published keys from the
      key-signer. This can be reduced by adding a random back-off in the client
      between the two steps.
      </p>

      <p>
      Finally, simple IP-based identification can be avoided as long as the
      client uses three distinct TOR routes, one to talk to each of the three
      components.
      </p>
