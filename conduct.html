      <p><i>
      Everything on this page consists only of my personal views,

      communities I may be a part of. Just so we're clear.

        My Spaces
      </h2>

      <p>
      I am fortunate enough to have control over several small spaces on the internet
      that are effectively "mine". These include (but are not necessarily limited to)
      this website and the various github projects under my account. Creating a
      separate code of conduct for each of those locations would be rather silly, so
      here's a blanket statement.
      </p>

      <p>
      This code of conduct is
      <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">in the public domain</a>.
      This means that you are free to do pretty much whatever you want with it
      (including copying without attribution) although of course attribution is
      always appreciated. It is derived from the example anti-harassment policy
      on the Geek Feminism wiki.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Code of Conduct
      </h3>

      <p>
      I am dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free
      experience for everyone. I do not tolerate harassment of participants
      in any form. Anybody who chooses to work with me in any of my spaces is
      implicitly bound by this policy as well.
      </p>

      <p>
      This code of conduct applies to all of my spaces as enumerated above.
      Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled
      from these spaces at my discretion.
      </p>

      <p>
      Harassment includes but is not limited to:
      <ul>
        <li>Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, or religion</li>
        <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they are not appropriate</li>
        <li>Threats or incitement of violence</li>
        <li>Stalking or following</li>
        <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
        <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>
        Reporting
      </h3>

      <p>
      If you are being harassed by anybody in one of my spaces,
      notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
      concerns, please contact me immediately at
      <a href="mailto:eapache@gmail.com">eapache@gmail.com</a>.
      If <i>I</i> am an offending party, please let me know; it is certainly not
      intentional and I will make every effort to correct my behaviour. I
      will respond as promptly as I can.
      </p>

      <p>
      I will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
      victims of abuse. At my discretion, I may publicly name a person
      about whom Iâ€™ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn
      third parties about them, if I believe that doing so will increase
      the safety of the community or the general public. I will not
      name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Consequences
      </h3>

      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
      comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, I may
      take any action I deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all
      spaces I control, and identification of the participant as a harasser to
      the general public.
      </p>

        Wireshark
      </h2>

      <p>
      As a core developer of the
      <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark open-source project</a>, I
      should note that that project has not adopted a code of conduct, despite
      at least one proposal.
      </p>

      <p>
      To the best of my knowledge, behaviour in the Wireshark community has always
      been exemplary. Additionally, I will personally make every effort to uphold
      my code of conduct (above) when I am able. However, I am only one member of
      the core team, so I am unable to make any guarantees.
